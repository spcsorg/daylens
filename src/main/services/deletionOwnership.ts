// Deletion ownership registry (privacy-retention-and-sync.md §Deletion,
// canonical-deletion ticket).
//
// Every table in the production schema is classified here, and the structural
// test (tests/deletionOwnership.test.ts) fails when a table exists that this
// registry does not know — so a new evidence-derived table cannot silently
// escape deletion. The registry states, for each table, which deletion path
// owns removing its rows when the person deletes the evidence in scope.
//
// Kinds:
//   evidence — raw captured, connected, or high-sensitivity source rows.
//   derived  — rebuilt projections, indexes, caches, and aggregates whose
//              rows exist only because evidence does; deletion of the
//              evidence in scope must remove or rebuild them.
//   user     — user-authored facts, corrections, grants, threads, and
//              connections; deleted by their own explicit flows, never as a
//              side effect of evidence deletion.
//   system   — infrastructure and bookkeeping with no personal evidence
//              content; removed by device-level deletion only.
