// computes the slides deterministically from WrappedPeriodFacts (a SUM of
// frozen daily snapshots — the stat card reads the same facts, so they can't
// disagree), and the model writes one line per slide id, plus one curious
// question and a closing reflection. Rejected lines fall back per slide.
