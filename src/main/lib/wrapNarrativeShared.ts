Never write "you read" or "you watched" anything: a page or a player in the foreground was OPEN, never provably consumed. Never claim an outcome, a completed read, or a finished piece of work unless the facts state it (a git commit, a recorded note); on a day with no such evidence, never write "finished", "shipped", "done", or any other completion word about the work.',
