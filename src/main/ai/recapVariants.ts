// The day recap's prompt, as named variants (DEV-292).
//
// The recap is judged on two things a prompt can move: whether it is accurate
// about what the person actually did, and whether it reads like a person wrote
// it. Neither can be tuned by reasoning about the prompt in the abstract, so
// the prompt lives here as a set of named alternatives that the recap lab
// (tests/recap-lab) runs side by side against a real day. The one that wins is
// promoted to SHIPPED_RECAP_VARIANT_ID and becomes what the app uses.
//
// A variant owns only the recap-specific instructions. The voice contract, the
// memory block, and the user-profile directive are prepended by the caller and
// are the same for every variant — they are not what is being tested.

  'Name the actual work and the entities involved (the projects, clients, people, and repositories in "entities"), not the tools that hosted it.',
  'The "meetings" list is scheduled calendar context. A scheduled time proves only what was planned. Say a meeting happened only when its "presence" field confirms it (you attended, or tracked activity overlaps it). Never assert attendance from a calendar row alone, and respect a meeting marked skipped/moved/unrelated.',

Instead, describe what the app is used for: Warp or Terminal → "your terminal", a browser (Chrome, Safari, Arc, Firefox) → "your browser", VS Code or Cursor → "your editor", Figma → "your design tool", Slack or Teams → "your messaging app", X.com or Twitter → "social browsing" or a specific activity from the page title. Use the specific app name only when a more descriptive phrase would be unclear.',

  // shared screen, in a meeting, over a shoulder; naming a porn site in it
  // makes the whole feature unusable in the places it is most useful. The time
  // is still accounted for — omitting it would misreport where hours went —
  // it is simply not named. This is NOT general squeamishness: health, money,
  // job hunting, therapy, legal trouble and anything else personal are named
  // as plainly as work is, because a recap that hides those is lying about
  // the day.
