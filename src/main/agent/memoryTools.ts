// The propose_memory tool (memory-and-entities.md §Conversational memory,
// DEV-185). When a conversation reveals a durable personal or work fact, the
// agent PROPOSES saving it: the proposed statement and its future use are
// shown through the same askUser card that gates file access, and nothing
// persists until the person confirms — "Save to memory" saves it, a typed
// correction saves the corrected text (typing it IS the confirmation), and a
// decline records a rejection so the same fact is not proposed again without
// new evidence. Secrets, credentials, health, and financial facts are refused
// before the card ever appears.
