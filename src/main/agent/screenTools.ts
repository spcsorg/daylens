// The contract, in order:
//   1. Consent gate OUTSIDE the model: the screen-context experiment toggle in
//      Settings (plus the OS Screen Recording permission). Off → an honest
//      refusal the model can relay, never a prompt.
//   2. A mandatory `reason` — it shows verbatim in the activity trail, so the
//      user always sees why the agent looked.
//   3. Pixels reach the model as an image content part and nothing else: the
//      tool's JSON result (what the trace persists) carries only metadata,
//      and the frame is dropped from memory once handed to the model.
