// Deterministic answer facts (WO-53 / AC-AIA-002.4, AI Agent blueprint
// "Deterministic activity totals, counts, dates, relationships, and time
// intervals shall come from eligible structured evidence rather than a model
// choice").
//
// The bug this closes (DEV-246): a chat answer's headline number could differ
// from the number Timeline and Apps show for the same day, because the model
// was free to restate, round, or re-derive a total it had been handed. The fix
// is not a better prompt. It is a computed value that wins.
//
// Every figure here is read from queryCorrectedActivityFactsForDay — the ONE
// canonical corrected-facts boundary that the Timeline projection and the Apps
// view also read. Nothing in this module re-implements activity, time, or
// attribution; if a total here ever disagreed with the UI, the boundary itself
// would be wrong and both would move together.
//
// Scope is deliberately one headline figure per dimension. A question asks for
// "the" total or "the" count; binding a single computed value to the answer's
// single stated value is unambiguous. Trying to police every incidental number
// in a paragraph would need claim-to-subject attribution the answer text does
// not reliably carry, and a mis-attributed repair is worse than none.
