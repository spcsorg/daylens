// Adversarial honesty checks. Each block builds the situation most likely to
// TEMPT the writer into a specific dishonest claim and proves the
// deterministic guards kill it — as true negatives, with an honest control
// line that must survive, so the guard is strict without being trigger-happy.
//
// The same guard functions run inside the live benchmark's deterministic
// pre-check (tests/wrapped-bench/harness.ts) and inside the runtime validator,
// so a live deck that makes any of these claims fails the paid gate AND never
// ships to a user. The six claims:
//   1. attendance         — a calendar event is a schedule, not proof of presence
//   2. unobserved time    — time away from the screen is unknown, never narrated
//   3. reading / watching — an open page or player was open, not consumed
//   4. finishing          — no completion claim without a verified artifact
//   5. attention quality  — an unbroken stretch is observable, "focus" is not
//   6. an unwritten plan  — no morning-intention field exists; any plan is invented
