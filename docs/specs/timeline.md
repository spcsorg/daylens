# Timeline

**Status:** Accepted.

This specification defines the first V2 Timeline: a calendar-like account of what actually happened during one day.

Timeline is not a list of applications and is not a productivity score. It turns shared activity facts into understandable blocks while preserving the evidence and corrections underneath them.

## Product behavior

The first release opens to one day. It shows:

- what happened
- when it happened
- how long it took
- the project, client, meeting, people, pages, or files involved when known
- honest gaps where Daylens was paused, idle, asleep, locked, unavailable, or uncertain

Week and month Timeline views are outside the first release. Apps still supports day, week, and month ranges.

## Day layout

- The primary layout is a vertical calendar aligned to local wall-clock time.
- The selected day and timezone are always visible.
- A current-day indicator follows the local clock.
- Blocks use their actual start and end positions; visual minimum height never changes the displayed duration.
- Overlapping calendar information is resolved into one chronology rather than a second disconnected lane.
- Personal and entertainment activity appears in the same Timeline and can be filtered or visually softened.
- Empty, partial, live, complete, imported, and capture-unavailable days have explicit states.

The day header shows canonical captured time and the number of meaningful blocks. It does not show a focus or productivity score.

## Timeline block

A block is one contiguous, understandable stretch of activity with a coherent subject or goal.

Each block contains:

- stable block identity
- start, end, and active duration
- direct human label
- live, complete, partial, corrected, or uncertain state
- dominant subject and optional project or client
- involved applications, pages, files, people, meetings, and repositories
- category used for visual organization
- source evidence references
- correction history

Applications and pages are evidence inside a block. They do not automatically define its intent or boundaries.

## Segmentation

Strong block boundaries are:

- idle, sleep, lock, pause, or capture failure
- the beginning or end of a supported meeting
- a sustained subject, project, or client change
- an explicit split or merge correction
- a long enough unobserved gap that continuity cannot be supported

Brief tool switches, page checks, messages, and supporting research remain inside the surrounding block when their entities and timing support the same activity.

Segmentation is deterministic for the same facts, projection version, and corrections. A model may propose a label or relationship but cannot own durations or silently change block boundaries.

## Labels and descriptions

A label describes the activity, not the software:

- “Developed the Daylens Wrapped feature”
- “Reviewed ACME’s FY2026–2027 financial report”
- “Researched television upgrade options”

“Cursor,” “Chrome browsing,” and “Editor activity” are fallback evidence labels, not acceptable final labels when Daylens knows the subject.

A block may include one short observation when it is supported and useful. It must not judge productivity, focus, distraction, or personal worth.

When evidence conflicts, the block states the specific uncertainty naturally and keeps the competing evidence inspectable.

The label voice is recorded as an evaluatable rubric in [label-voice.md](label-voice.md). The real-day review and the hermetic timeline evaluation score produced labels against it.

## Meetings

Meetings are unified Timeline blocks rather than a separate calendar layer.

- A calendar event alone appears as scheduled context, not proof the meeting occurred.
- Device activity, call presence, Granola, transcript, or explicit confirmation can support “you met.”
- A meeting block includes title, participants, organization or client, scheduled and observed times, notes or transcript references, and surrounding related work when permitted.
- A meeting running longer or shorter than scheduled uses observed active time while preserving the scheduled range as context.
- Overlapping calendar events do not create additive time.
- A person can mark a scheduled meeting as attended, skipped, moved, or unrelated.

## Live day

- The current block has stable identity while evidence is still arriving.
- Its end time and duration update without rebuilding unrelated blocks.
- A provisional label may improve as pages, files, connectors, and entities arrive.
- The interface indicates that the block is live without exposing internal confidence scores.
- Finalization after an app switch, meeting edge, idle boundary, or day rollover preserves the block identity when its facts remain the same.
- Restart recovery never extends a live block through an unobserved gap.

## Evidence inspection

Opening a block shows an explanation first, followed by grouped supporting evidence:

- applications
- websites and pages
- files and documents
- meetings and people
- repositories and connected records
- capture and gap state

Evidence displays source, observed time, and relevant relationship. Raw telemetry is available without becoming the block’s primary language. High-sensitivity evidence follows its own access and retention rules.

## Corrections

A person can:

- rename a block
- merge adjacent blocks
- split a block at a selected time
- change category
- assign or remove project and client relationships
- mark meeting attendance
- exclude specific evidence
- permanently delete a record or block
- undo every non-destructive correction

Corrections preview their effect on time, entities, Timeline, Apps, search, and the AI agent before they are applied.

A correction is durable product data. Reprojection, restart, source refresh, and model changes cannot overwrite it.

Permanent deletion is clearly separated from reversible exclusion or correction and requires confirmation.

## Filters

The first day view supports filters for:

- work, personal, entertainment, and other categories
- application or website
- project or client
- person or meeting
- captured, corrected, or uncertain state

Filters never recalculate duration differently. The visible total is the sum of the filtered canonical blocks.

## Data ownership

Timeline reads corrected activity facts through one main-process query boundary. It does not query raw evidence or calculate time in the renderer.

The projection owns:

- block boundaries
- active duration
- entity and meeting relationships
- evidence membership
- gap types
- projection version

The renderer owns layout, interaction, and presentation only.

## Failure behavior

- Missing permission or capture failure produces an explained gap, not fabricated activity.
- A failed interpretation keeps the deterministic block with a direct factual fallback label.
- A failed connector does not remove already captured device activity.
- A projection failure leaves the last valid day readable and offers a retry.
- An empty day distinguishes no activity, paused capture, unavailable capture, and a day outside retained history.
- Conflicting corrections do not apply partially; the command fails atomically.

## Acceptance criteria

- Representative days are recognizable without opening every block.
- Timeline and Apps totals match for the same date and filters.
- Meetings, personal activity, entertainment, idle, pause, sleep, and capture failures appear honestly.
- Labels name the understood activity when evidence supports it.
- Live block identity remains stable through normal updates and finalization.
- Every correction survives restart and reprojection and changes all consuming surfaces.
- Evidence inspection shows provenance without leaking excluded or deleted content.
- Daylight-saving changes, midnight, clock changes, restart, overlapping events, and long gaps have regression coverage.
- The day remains usable with a representative full year stored locally.
- The running application is reviewed with real or representative days on every supported desktop platform.

## Implementation starting point

The first ticket should move live and historical day reads behind one corrected activity-fact query, preserving current UI behavior. New segmentation or visual work begins only after both paths produce the same sessions, totals, gaps, and corrections.
