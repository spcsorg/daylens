# Daylens V2

**Status:** Accepted product direction.

**The only planning document.** Scope, status, blockers, and acceptance criteria.
Everything else was deleted on 2026-09-04 — it was stale, contradicted itself, or
duplicated a tracker. Product behaviour lives in `docs/specs/`; how to build and ship
lives in `docs/operations/`. Nothing else plans V2.

**Linear project Daylens V2 is the backlog.** This document is the plan; it does not
duplicate the backlog. GitHub Issues exist for people outside the project to report
things, and get triaged into Linear.

Issue references below are Linear `DEV-nnn`. A bare `#nn` means `spcsorg/daylens`;
`irachrist1#nn` is the older personal repo, which still holds open PRs — the two
repositories number their issues independently, so a bare `#nn` is ambiguous unless
qualified.

## On the board

```
DAYLENS — WHAT WE ARE FIXING

The one test:   npm run eval:days
   names the work        85%  ->  95%
   never names a tool    97%  ->  99%
   honest about gaps     95%  -> 100%

 1  NAME THE WORK, NOT THE TOOL      <- biggest gap
 2  COUNT THE TIME HONESTLY
 3  MAKE IT FAST                     <2s launch, <200ms paint
 4  THE APPS VIEW MUST BE TRUE
 5  CHAT: FAST, AND NEVER CONTRADICTS ITSELF

Cannot ship without:  Windows cert · billing live · calendar off icalBuddy

Done = a stranger opens their day and it reads true.
```

Everything below is the detail behind those five lines. If the two ever disagree,
the board is the promise and the detail is what is currently known.

## What V2 is

**Daylens describes your day the way you would.** Not the tabs you had open — the work you
actually did.

That is one measurable thing, and the measurement already exists. `npm run eval:days` scores
19 ground-truth days against the journal the owner actually wrote. Today:

```
primary work named:   85%   (threshold 85%)
tool-surface clean:   97%   (threshold 95%)
gap honesty:          95%   (threshold 95%)
```

Two of three are sitting exactly on their floor. What that percentage means in practice, from
today's run:

```
✗ primary work never named anywhere visible: TARS (chief-of-staff skill, npm publish, landing page)
✗ primary work never named anywhere visible: ML study (Coursera)
✗ block label is a tool surface, not work: "Cursor Agents"      ×6
✗ block label is a tool surface, not work: "ChatGPT"            ×4
✗ block label is a tool surface, not work: "Claude Code"
✗ wrapped line presents banned-as-work "claude": "Claude quietly took 22m today."
```

You spent a day building TARS and the app said "Cursor Agents". That is the product failing at
the only thing it claims to do.

**V2 ships when the eval reads 95 / 99 / 100 and a stranger's day reads true on first open.**

The model that gets there is written down: [activity understanding](north-star/activity-understanding.md)
and [the context agent](north-star/context-agent.md). Both were deleted by accident in
`d5cdcdbe` — a commit about eval plumbing — and are restored.

## The five blockers

Ranked by how much each moves the score above. Issue IDs are Linear `DEV-nnn` and
`spcsorg/daylens#nn` — both, always, so the trackers and this document cannot drift.

### 1. The day is named after tools instead of work

The single biggest gap: 15% of primary work is never named, and tool surfaces still leak into
labels. `activity-understanding.md` gives the naming ladder — durable entity, then subject
inferred from content signals, then never the tool.

- **DEV-287 / #109** — the packet-based interpretation runtime is wired.
  `analyzeDay.ts` reads `interpretationAgentEnabled(getSettings())` and calls
  `runInterpretationAgentRelabel`, which assembles an interpret-purpose context
  packet and runs `AISdkAgentRuntime` over the read-only title, calendar, git,
  meeting-note, and entity tools. Historical relabels do not capture the live
  screen. If disclosure recording cannot persist, the local label stands. The
  Settings toggle defaults on. The remaining work is proving it beats the
  legacy path on `npm run eval:days`, then treating that as the default naming
  path. This is still the build that moves primary-work naming.
- **DEV-288 / #110** — **the backfill is in place.** `labelGuardRepair` rewrites stored
  `timeline_blocks` labels that fail today's work-name guards on startup, once per
  `WORK_NAME_GUARD_VERSION`. The finalize ladder also rejects those labels on read, so a
  compacted window title (`Cursor Agents — daylens …`) cannot persist as the block name
  after the stamp. Remaining naming work is DEV-287 (eval-proof the packet runtime).
- **DEV-223 / #21** — Timeline, Apps, chat and exports disagree about the same day.

**Done when:** `npm run eval:days` reports primary work ≥95% and tool-surface clean ≥99%, and
no block on any of the 19 ground-truth days is labelled with an app or assistant name.

### 2. Time is credited to the wrong thing

`activity-understanding.md` states the rule: **attention is the budget.** One foreground window
at a time — that is the application total. Site totals may also fill a browser's full-screen
second-monitor visible span (DEV-223); they still cannot exceed that browser's in-front time
plus its own visible time. Netflix once took 1249s inside a block where the browsers held ~800
foreground seconds — that kind of over-credit, with no visible presence to explain it, is still
wrong.

- **DEV-246 / #68** — "how long was I on Coursera this week" returned the wrong first number
  because the name was looked up as an app and per-site duration was left to the model.
  Domain-time questions now resolve through website lookup and a computed `site_total_time`
  from the same reconciled website ledger Apps reads, including second-monitor fill.
- **DEV-290 / #112** — `HISTORY_FILL_MAX_MS` lets a titleless browser credit up to 4h to its
  last-visited page, usually Netflix or YouTube. The original ticket said to populate
  `browser_context_events`; that table was dropped (`migrations.ts:2071`). The restated
  fix is: persist Chromium `active_browser_context` when history corroborates an
  unverifiable-mode tab, and cap uncorroborated entertainment history-fill on titleless
  browsers at two minutes.
- **DEV-238 / #60** — half of browser time has no page attached.

**Done when:** no domain's credited seconds exceed its browser's in-front plus second-display
visible seconds in the same interval, on all 19 eval days; and ten random domain-time questions
match the reconciled website ledger Timeline and Apps already read.

### 3. Startup and navigation are slow

**DEV-259 / irachrist1#253** measured this and fixed the dominant cost — a 5.7s unconditional
`PRAGMA integrity_check` before `createWindow()`, now a 1.2s `quick_check` that escalates only
on a real fault. Dev launch went ~12s → ~6.6s. Left from that issue's own checklist:

- **~1.1s of eager module eval** at Electron ready. The AI SDK and ExcelJS load at top level, on
  the paint path. Lazy-import them.
- **DEV-261 / #83** — the app freezes for minutes and silently stops recording. Half done:
  `stallWatchdog.ts:135` captures `main_thread_stalled` to telemetry, but nothing writes a
  marker the day itself can show, which is what the acceptance below asks for.

Measured 2026-09-04 on the real 1.19GB profile (`npm run bench:surfaces`):
`getTimelineDayPayload` 111-166ms, `getAllAppsForLabeling` 16-53ms. **The database is not the
bottleneck — do not spend time on SQL here.**

**Done when:** cold launch to an interactive Timeline under 2s; Timeline → Apps → Chat paints
under 200ms; a stall over 5s writes a marker the day can show.

### 4. Apps view lies about what you did there

- **DEV-237 / #59** — summaries are unreliable: raw JSON on screen, empty summaries where time
  was tracked, invented specifics.
- **DEV-239 / #61** — junk strings shown as activity; the same app twice; 1-2s visits get rows.
- **DEV-240 / #62** — wrong icons, unbelievable ranking, real hours hidden from the main list.

**Done when:** Apps opens in under 500ms; the five most-used apps at Today / 7d / 30d each show a
summary matching what you remember; each app appears once; short visits collapse to one line.

### 5. AI chat is slow and contradicts itself

- **DEV-243 / #65** — "Loading AI…" on a blank screen every open. `AIWorkspace.tsx:451` returns
  early while `settings` and `hasApiKey` are null, so nothing renders — not even the input box.
- **DEV-242 / #64** — provider and model state disagree between Settings and the chat picker.
- **DEV-292 / #114** — the day recap times out on two stacked 15s timeouts, with model-tier
  selection that does not do what it claims. One measured budget, following `NARRATIVE_TIMEOUT_MS`.
- **DEV-244 / #66**, **DEV-245 / #67** — tool activity is a wall of files; no structured progress.

**Done when:** the chat paints its input under 200ms before settings resolve; first token under
2s; opening repeatedly never blanks; switching provider changes the next answer.

## Chores that gate distribution

Real, required to release, felt by nobody until release day.

- **Windows code-signing certificate.** Azure Trusted Signing, ~$10/month.
  `release-windows.yml:100` hard-fails without it and `updater.ts:218` disables updates.
  Owner action.
- **Billing via pawapay** while the Flutterwave application is in progress. No checkout can
  render today: `DAYLENS_BILLING_API_URL` is never set and no service is deployed.
- **CI lives on `spcsorg`.** Blacksmith is installed on the org, not the personal account.
- **DEV-487, the morning/evening crash.** Rare, and now self-reporting — the frame goes to
  PostHog. Screenshot it when it fires.
- ~~**DEV-229 / #51** — trusts the accessibility flag instead of verifying capture works.~~
  **Shipped.** `services/permissionWatcher.ts` verifies with real reads and
  `getCaptureVerificationState` exposes it. Linear says Done; GitHub #51 is still open and
  should be closed.
- **DEV-255 / #77** — calendar on macOS now reads EventKit through `calendar-helper`
  instead of icalBuddy. Windows still uses Outlook COM; Linux has no store. Needs
  acceptance on a Mac: events after one Calendar prompt, no CLI installed.
- ~~**DEV-289 / #111** — focus score and distraction alerter are spec-removed but fully live.~~
  **Decided 2026-09-07:** revive them in the spec and keep the live code.
  See [V2 feature dispositions](product/v2.md) and [Focus score and distraction alerts](specs/focus-and-distraction.md).
- **DEV-207** — the V2 acceptance run. The gate itself; it cannot pass until the five close.

## Where the code actually is

**Works.** Calendar and Granola agent tools · Timeline merge, zoom, week popover ·
per-slide wrap export · screen-context honesty pane · corrupt-database recovery with
restore/fresh/quit · readable memory mirror · the 5.7s startup integrity scan, fixed ·
interpretation-agent packet runtime behind `interpretationAgentEnabled` — #109.

**Half-built.**
- ~~`site_total_time` missing from `DeterministicFactKind`~~ — #68 / DEV-223; domain-time questions compute and enforce a site total from the reconciled ledger, including second-monitor fill
- Context Inspector: backend fills `ChatAgentResult.evidence`, no UI reads it
- ~~command palette never reaches `planRetrieval`~~ — **not true**;
  `search.handlers.ts:56` returns `planRetrieval(...)`
- entity write-through: `adoptAppIdentityWrite` and `adoptArtifactWrite` exported, uncalled
- screen context captures frames with `noExtractorInstalled`
  (`screenContext.handlers.ts:61`); backlog full at 100 frames, all quarantined — #73
- `browser_context_events` was dropped in migration 42 (never written in production). Live
  page capture is `website_visits` with source `active_browser_context`.

**Not started.** Billing at a real boundary · Windows signing · a model-optional Timeline ·
the ~1.1s of eager module eval on the paint path.

**Gone.** The OAuth connector framework, removed 2026-07-26. Not V2 scope, no longer gates
the release.

## Not in V2

Windows tracking before a consent screen — **intentional**; the download is the disclosure.
macOS notarization ($99, a Gatekeeper warning, not a dead platform). Database
retention/VACUUM. Dual capture pipelines. Linux capture helper and Wayland. Windows Store.
Web companion and sync. Wrapped telemetry. Settings redesign.

## Release channels

Stable from tags, Nightly automatically from `main`, independent feeds. Pattern from
`pingdotgg/t3code` — same stack.

Channel derives from the binary's own version (`X.Y.Z-nightly.YYYYMMDD.<run>`). Stable
omits `channel` and keeps `latest-mac.yml`; nightly sets `channel: "nightly"` →
`nightly-mac.yml`, published as a prerelease in the same repo. `allowPrerelease` must be
true on nightly or electron-updater silently finds nothing. Merge the per-arch macOS
manifests before upload or one architecture stops updating with no error.

**One deviation:** separate `userData` per channel. t3code shares one directory. We have a
1.2GB SQLite database with a migration chain that already renumbers, and a nightly running
a forward migration would leave stable unable to open its own database. Distinct `appId`
and `productName`, side-by-side install. DEV-293 consolidates the four existing profile
directories first.
