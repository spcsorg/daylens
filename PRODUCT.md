# Daylens — what we're building

Daylens answers one question: **"What did I actually get done today?"**

It quietly watches what you do on your computer — the apps you use, the windows you're in,
the sites you visit — and turns it into an honest picture of your day. Nothing leaves your
machine unless you ask it to.

## The one idea everything is built on

Daylens groups your activity by **what you were trying to do**, not by which app was open.

- A **block** is one continuous stretch of a single thing, shown on your Timeline.
  Example: *"Configuring the work network, 9:00–12:00."* You were in the Ubiquiti dashboard,
  Photos, and Terminal — Daylens shows that as **one block**, named for what you were *doing*,
  not three blocks named after apps. For example a quick 2-minute glance at X(a.ka twitter) gets folded in, not called
  out as its own thing.
- A **thread** is the bigger goal that ties blocks together across the day or week.
  Example: you set up the router in the morning and come back to fix DNS at 2pm — that's
  two blocks, but **one thread**: *"Set up the work network."* Threads are what show up in
  "What mattered" and the weekly review.

That's the whole model: your day is **blocks** (what you see) grouped into **threads**
(what mattered).

## The three things you can do

1. **Timeline** — your day as a clean list of blocks, each sized by how long it took and
   named for what you did. Distractions live separately, not mixed into your work.
2. **Apps** — pick one app (say Ghostty) and see what you actually did in it. Same
   intelligence, filtered to one app.
3. **AI** — ask "What did I get done yesterday?" and get a calm, specific answer, like a
   sharp assistant who watched your day. Morning briefs and a Spotify-Wrapped-style weekly
   review come from the same place and can be triggered by a notification, through command + k search option or even a shortcut key.

All three read from the **same** blocks and threads. If the Timeline says 3 hours of network
work, the AI says the same. **One truth, three views.**

## What Daylens is NOT

- **No grades.** No "Score," no "Focused," no "Drift." We don't judge your day. We show it. It's a tool, not a judge. Minimal and focused.
- **No guessing out loud.** Daylens says what the evidence proves. If it doesn't know, it
  says so plainly — it never pads with "likely…" or robotic precision like
  "32 minutes 22 seconds in Codex."

## How Daylens talks

Like the Dia morning brief (read more about it here: https://www.diabrowser.com/start) daylens is short, specific, grounded. Every claim traces back to something real. It feels like a friend who is watching your day and is able to give you a concise summary of what you did today or last week or last month. 

## How we build it

Five rules the whole app obeys:

1. **Evidence first** — the raw activity is the truth; everything is derived from it and can be rebuilt from it.
2. **Blocks before threads** — figure out the continuous stretches first, then group them into goals.
3. **Your corrections win** — if you rename, merge, or hide something, that sticks and teaches Daylens.
4. **Facts before words** — the AI narrates real numbers; it never invents them.
5. **Admit uncertainty** — when Daylens isn't sure, it says so instead of making something up.

We build one view at a time — **Timeline first, then Apps, then AI, then wraps** — and prove each one works on a real day, week, or month before moving to the next.
